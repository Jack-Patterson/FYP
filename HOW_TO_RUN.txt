Unity Version 2022.3.16f1 (Any LTS 2022 version shouldn't change anything)
Unity project has all packages installed

Python version 3.8
Open terminal in FYP MLAgentsPython folder
> .\Scripts\activate (NOT activate.bat or anything else just activate)
> pip install mlagents
> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
> pip install onnx
> pip install protobuf==3.20.3
type mlagents-learn just to check that its all installed correctly
> mlagents-learn .\config\FYP_Movement_cfg.yaml --run-id=MoveToPointWithObstaclesWithLongerSight --resume
That starts the python side of things

Click run on the unity editor once the python side says it's listening on a port
It should run.
